# Smart Knob by jennellew

## Overview

This is a smart home controller that controls Kasa Smart Bulbs and Smart Plugs without the use of an app or voice assistant.

Smart Bulbs' brightness can be controlled by the built-in dial or UI, while Smart Plugs can be toggled off with a simple tap.

This project uses [Waveshare's Knob Display Dev Board](https://www.waveshare.com/esp32-s3-knob-touch-lcd-1.8.htm) and is built for the onboard ESP32-S3.

## Features

 - Plugs can be toggled on/off
 - Bulbs can be toggled on/off
 - Bulb brightness is controlled by knob or UI interface
 - Screen dims and sleeps after inactivity
