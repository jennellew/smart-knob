# Smart Knob by jennellew

## Overview

No more fumbling through apps and shouting at voice assistants, Knobby brings the joy of physical control back to smart home automation. It's what you wish your Nest thermostat could do if it weren't fixed to the wall.

The built-in dial or UI can control Smart Bulbs' brightness, while Smart Plugs can be toggled off with a simple tap.

This project uses [Waveshare's Knob Display Dev Board](https://www.waveshare.com/esp32-s3-knob-touch-lcd-1.8.htm) and is built for the onboard ESP32-S3.
